# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Songul. I have a Ph.D. in Economics and am currently exploring data science and machine learning. I enjoy cooking, mostly Mediterranean cuisine, but try recipes from many other cuisines. I also love traveling!

# Goals for This Course

My goals for this course include:
- Enhancing my skills in Python programming.
- Gaining a deeper understanding of data science techniques.
- Applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems.

# My First Python Program

Here is a simple "Hello, World!" program in Python:

```python
# This is a simple Python program
print("Hello, World!")
