# Week 1 Reflections

## Introduction

In the first week of learning Python, I reviewed fundamental concepts related to variables, arithmetic operations, and logical operations.

## Key Learnings

- **Types of Variables**: I reviewed different types of variables in Python, including integers, floats, and strings. Understanding these types is essential for storing and manipulating data effectively.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: I revisited basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations are fundamental for performing calculations in Python.
- **Logical Operations**: I also reviewed logical operations. These operations perform logical comparisons and control the flow of programs based on conditions.

## Reflections

This week has been valuable as I refreshed my understanding of how Python handles data and performs calculations. The concepts of arithmetic and logical operations are foundational for building more complex programs. Iâ€™m eager to apply these basics in more advanced coding scenarios.

## Goals for Next Week

For the upcoming week, I aim to:
- Deepen my understanding of functions and how to use them.
- Explore control flow statements like `if`, `else`, and `elif`.
- Begin experimenting with more complex data structures.
